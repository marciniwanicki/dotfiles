The repository contains a mix of popular open sourced dotfiles shared
on github as well as my own random setup.
**To be clear, I do not recommend you to fork that project :-)** First, there are much
better and well maintained dotfiles out there, second, you might end up
installing lots of stuff on you machine that will never be used. It's probably
better if you spend some time reading the files and crafting new ones
fitting best your own needs. I bet you will do it well and even learn some
new shell tricks.
