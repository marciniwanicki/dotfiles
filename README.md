This repository is a personal collection of dotfiles: a mix of popular, open-sourced tools and configs and my own random setup.  

**Note:** I don't recommend using "as-is" or forking this repo.  
- There are better-maintained dotfile projects out there.  
- Running these scripts might install a bunch of tools you'll never use.  

Instead, I suggest browsing the files, taking inspiration, and building dotfiles that fit your own workflow. You'll probably pick up some new shell tricks along the way.

## Installation

If you *really* want to install my setup:

```zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marciniwanicki/dotfiles/main/bin/install.sh)"
```
